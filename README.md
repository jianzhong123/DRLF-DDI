# DRLF-DDI
We propose DRLF-DDI, a dual-view representation learning framework for DDIE prediction. Specifically, in the individual drug view, DRLF-DDI designs an autoencoder module with multi-head attention mechanism to generate enhanced Morgan fingerprints; in the interaction view, a DDI-Transformer module is introduced to capture the interaction features.
